Craig's QA Kit
Craig's QA Kit is a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline test preparation and execution for QA engineers. Originally developed to reduce the time spent setting up specific test cases at work, this kit has grown into a collection of useful command-line tools that benefit both novice and experienced testers.

Overview
Why This Kit?
In many testing scenarios—like when running NWTest on multicast addresses—testers previously had to manually search for, copy, and remember addresses before running their tests. With Craig's QA Kit, you can automatically scan for multicast addresses and feed them directly into NWTest, eliminating manual steps and reducing errors. This is just one example of how the kit saves time and simplifies repetitive tasks across hundreds of tests.

Key Features
Automated Test Preparation:
Reduce setup time by automating common test preparations with a suite of built-in utilities.

NWTest Multicast Automation:
Quickly scan for multicast addresses and integrate them seamlessly with NWTest—no more manual copying or command memorization.

Alias Creation:
Easily create an alias to run the kit from any directory, making it readily accessible.

Stress Testing Tools:
Run CPU, memory, and I/O stress tests with simple, guided commands to evaluate system performance under load.

Dependency Checks:
Built-in functions verify that required tools (such as ImageMagick, FFmpeg, NWTest, stress, and stress-ng) are installed and provide helpful feedback if they're missing.

Use Case Example
Traditionally, setting up an NWTest multicast scenario involved:

Finding the correct multicast address.
Copying or remembering that address.
Manually constructing and executing the NWTest command.
With Craig's QA Kit, these steps are automated. The kit scans for multicast addresses, displays them in your terminal, and automatically uses them with NWTest—all in one go. This not only saves time but also minimizes potential errors, especially when running large volumes of tests.
