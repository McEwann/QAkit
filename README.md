This is a kit I created around my job, the purpose was to cut down on time spent prepping for specific test cases, I expanded on this tool to include lots of useful tools for new & experienced testers. 

an example being needing to NWtest multicast addresses, we had to find the address, copy it somewhere or remember it and run nwtest on it, now we can use this tool to scan for all multicast, and see the IP address on the terminal at the same time as entering it into an NWTest and without having to remember the NWtest commands and args. nothing special but actually a decent time save over hundereds of tests.

there are bugs, and areas I haven't used myself but have implimented for other users, if you find any issues report them and I'll fix them asap or just make change requests yourself.
