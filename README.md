# Craig's QA Kit

**Craig's QA Kit** is a collection of command-line utilities designed to streamline and expedite testing workflows for QA engineers. Originally created to reduce the time spent preparing specific test cases at work, this kit has grown into a versatile toolkit packed with useful features for both new and experienced testers.

---

## Overview

Traditionally, when working with multicast addresses for NWTest, testers had to:

- **Manually search for the multicast address**  
- **Copy or memorize the address**  
- **Construct and run the NWTest command with the correct arguments**  

Craig's QA Kit automates this process by scanning for multicast addresses, displaying them in the terminal, and directly integrating them with NWTest. This automation not only saves time but also minimizes errorsâ€”especially when running hundreds of tests.

## Key Features

- **Automated Test Preparation**  
  Quickly prepare and execute common test cases with minimal manual setup.

- **NWTest Multicast Automation**  
  Automatically scan for multicast addresses and feed them into NWTest without needing to remember or manually type commands.

- **Alias Creation**  
  Easily create an alias to run the kit from any directory.

- **Stress Testing Tools**  
  Run CPU, memory, and I/O stress tests with guided, user-friendly options.

- **Dependency Checks**  
  Built-in functions verify that required tools (such as ImageMagick, FFmpeg, NWTest, stress, and stress-ng) are installed, providing helpful feedback if any are missing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **ImageMagick** (for `convert`)  
- **FFmpeg** (for video processing)  
- **NWTest** (for network tests)  
- **stress** or **stress-ng** (for stress testing)  
- *(Optional)* **psutil** (for dynamic monitoring; install via `pip install psutil`)  

> **Note:**  
> The kit is designed primarily for **Linux**. It may also work on **macOS** with minor adjustments. Windows support is limited unless you use a Unix-like shell (e.g., Git Bash or WSL).
